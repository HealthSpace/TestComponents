        Burton "Gus" Guster is a fictional character on the USA Network
        television comedy Psych played by American actor Dul√© Hill. He functions
        as the "straight man" for Shawn Spencer's antics, and provides sobering
        advice, helpful knowledge, steady support, and friendship. Over the
        course of the show, Gus evolves from nothing more than a conventional,
        uptight pharmaceutical representative to a strong support system through
        all Shawn Spencer's crazy antics. He frequently tries to pass himself
        off as "fearless" although in reality the opposite is true, and often
        cries, sometimes due to "sympathy" and other times when Shawn is
        insensitive to his feelings. It is believed that Gus was named after a
        relative of Steve Franks, the technical producer of the show, Burton
        Franks.
